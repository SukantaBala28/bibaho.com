		<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
		<p>
			This agreement sets forth the Terms and Conditions for using, accessing or browsing content on Lingo121.com (hereafter simply “Lingo121” or “the Site”). If you wish to use the Site, please read this document carefully. By accessing the Site or any part of it, including all content and services provided by the Site, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with these Terms and Conditions, you must not use or access the Site or its content and services.

		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Lingo121 is a peer-to-peer digital platform that creates a marketplace to connect language learners with independent private language tutors. After successfully meeting the Site's application criteria, Tutor Profiles are generated with information such as the Tutor's name, teaching philosophy, availability, fees and other content. Potential learners use the site to (a) browse Tutor Profiles to find Tutor that matches their requirements, (b) book sessions, and (c) use the site’s payment processing tool to remit fees to their chosen Tutor. The site also contains some additional resources for Tutors and learners. <br /><br />

			Lingo121 is wholly owned and operated by <span style="font-style: italic">Lingo121 Language Tutoring Services Inc.</span> (hereinafter “the Company” or “We”), an educational services company registered and located in Ontario, Canada. As such it is governed by the relevant laws of Canada and the Province of Ontario. The Company maintains and markets the Site to help Tutors find, book, and collect payment from potential learners. In exchange, the Company charges a small fee, which is already included in the publicly advertised rates of each Tutor. 
		</p>

		<h3>Tutors</h3>
		<p>
			People wishing to provide independent language tutoring services to potential learners can apply to list their services on the Site. The Company uses various criteria to assess the suitability of the applicant tutor, including but not limited to verification of identity, confirmation of credentials, reference checks, and professional assessment of the Tutor’s ability to effectively instruct potential learners in a private, independent tutoring context. The Company reserves the right to accept or deny any applicant Tutor according to its assessment criteria.<br /><br /> 

			Tutors must provide the following information at the time of application: full legal name, teachable language(s), telephone number, e-mail address, postal address, professional references, photograph, introductory video (optional), resumé with details of education, relevant experience, and employment history, areas of expertise, description of teaching philosophy, requested hourly rate, preferred teaching locations, hobbies, and availability. The Site may also require the Tutor to link a social media account for identity verification. Furthermore, bank account or other payment information must be provided so the Site can remit accumulated tuition fees to the Tutors.<br /><br />

			By submitting an application, Tutors agree that we may perform identity and credential verification checks using a number of methods, including but not limited to reference checks, confirmation of university degrees or certifications with relevant bodies, social media profile link, and criminal background record check. All identity and credential verification checks performed by the Site adhere to our Privacy Policy guidelines (see <a href="/privacyPolicy" target="_blank">HERE</a>). 

			If the Tutor’s application is accepted, a basic Profile is created, which the Tutor is invited to customize. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal information is NOT automatically displayed on the Tutor's Profile (see Privacy Policy for further details)</span>.  The Company reserves the right to terminate a Tutor’s Profile and participation in Lingo121 at any time.<br /><br />

			The gross hourly rate is displayed on each Tutor’s profile and is calculated by adding a $5 Site fee to the hourly amount requested by the Tutor (e.g. If a Tutor requests $20/hour, the gross hourly rate displayed on their Profile is $25). The Site uses this fee to process payment, maintain the site, and, most importantly, build the marketplace so tutors have access to more learners.<br /><br />

			On the 30th of each month (28th in the case of February), the total amount of tuition fees accrued by a Tutor since the last payment date are deposited into the Tutor’s linked bank or paypal account. <br /><br />

			As independent contractors, Tutors are solely responsible for declaring to relevant government authorities any income made through the Site and remitting any and all taxes due and payable. If requested by a learner, a receipt for services rendered and payment received will be provided.
		</p>

		<h3>Learners</h3>
		<p>
			People seeking to hire Tutors (hereinafter “learners”) can search and view Tutor Profiles on the Site. Inside each Profile is a messaging tool for contacting the Tutor with questions (e.g. “Do you have experience with IELTS prep?), and a booking tool for requesting a session.<br /><br />

			When submitting a booking request, learners specify a date, time and location for their session. They can also indicate if it's a one-time booking or a multi-session request. Once the request is submitted, a notification is sent to the Tutor, who has 24 hours to respond. The Tutor can (1) accept the booking as specified, (2) reject the booking, or (3) suggest modifications to the date, time or location. If the booking is accepted, the session is set and no further action is required by either party except to show up at the appointed time and location.  If the booking is rejected, the learner will be directed back to the Site to search for alternate Tutors.  If the Tutor suggests an alternate date, time or location, the Tutor and learner will go back and forth until they have both accepted the mutually negotiated details.  If the Tutor does not reply within 24 hours, the learner will be sent a notification that the request has expired.<br /><br />

			Once they have made a booking, learners will be prompted to enter their payment information; this information is used to place a “hold” on the funds required for the transaction until one minute past the completed time period agreed upon, at which point the funds will be transferred to the Site for remittance of fees to the Tutor.  In the case of a multi-session booking, pro-rated funds will be transferred after each completed individual session. A $1 booking fee is applied to each transaction.<br /><br />

			Learners can cancel a booking up to 24 hours before the start time, but will be charged a $2 cancellation fee. If the cancellation is made less than 24 hours prior to the session’s start time, no refund is available.<br /><br />

			Learners can peruse Tutor profiles as a guest, however, they must create a profile to book sessions. Learners can review Tutors who they have booked, track their hours booked via the Site, download certificates of hours completed through the Site, and securely store and reuse payment information.
